            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am currently a "Fellow Emeritus" of Analog Devices, meaning I am mostly retired but I still stick my nose into various ADI projects. I have always been passionate about audio signal processing and circuit design, and since this passion did not end when I retired, I continue to pursue audio projects in my home lab. I also am an avid amateur musician (Jazz Saxophone), and currently play with a Steely Dan tribute band.</p>
            <p>My latest audio project involves an integration of LTspice with Matlab, which allows you to enter any circuit in LTspice, and enter a target frequency response in Matlab. The powerful Matlab non-linear least-squares optimizer then runs hundreds of LTspice simulations and varies the LTspice component values to arrive at an optimum match with the target response. It's great for a variety of purposes; for example, designing an analog filter to compensate for loudspeaker response, or for optimizing a complicated active filter network where you are trying to throw as many poles and zeros into a single op-amp as possible.</p>
            <p>This program was motivated by a similar program that I used more than 40 years ago when I worked at dbx. It was a text-only dos program written by Mark F. Davis, who was designing loudspeaker crossover networks, but it quickly became very popular for general circuit design within the company. </p>A link to download the program on gitHub is below; follow the Readme for instructions.</p>
